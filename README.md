The .apk file can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/SimeoW/kpa-to-psi/blob/master/compiled_app.apk), or generated by opening Android Studio, importing the project, then navigating to Build --> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) --> Build APK(s), where a dialog box will appear with a "locate" button, which will navigate to the generated APK file. Upon transfering the .apk file into Android, the file can simply be opened and installed.
